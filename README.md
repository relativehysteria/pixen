# Pixen

This is a small random project I made when I was bored. At first it was meant to
be a clone of a flash game called
[Pixel Zen](https://www.kongregate.com/games/neodeltai/pixel-zen) which I used
to play for a while during the summer of 2016, but I more or less gave up on
making it so fancy. I might return to it one day, add some particle effects
(similar to the original Pixel Zen), change the graphics library etc. Not sure.
